        <p>Patrick's first career was in direct sales with Verizon, where he rose to the top and became the go to rep for new sales people to model. He was quickly recruited by his own customer to manage a travelling sales team in the wholesale meat industry. After getting his fill in sales, Patrick realized he wanted to use these skills to work in a team environment. Soon after, he enrolled in the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp. Patrick has enjoyed learning how to create the very apps his Verizon customers use on their devices.</p>
